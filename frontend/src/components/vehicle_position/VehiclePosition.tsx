// This file is where we will have the logic and styling for the vehicle position component
// It will display the vehicle's current position on the map and update as the vehicle moves
// the position will b e determined by the time berween the last stop and the next stop
// and the time the vehicle is expected to arrive at the next stop
// we will use a simple linear interpolation to determine the position
// we will also display the vehicle's heading and speed if available
// we will use a simple arrow to indicate the heading
